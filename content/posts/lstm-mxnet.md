## Time series

Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals.

TSA(Time series analysis) applications:

* Pattern recognition

* Earthquake prediction

* Weather forecast

* Financial statistics

and many more‚Ä¶


## Problem

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hg1tYSG.jpg)
>  *with a newly-minted elite and an economic growth rate of over 10 percent, the environment has taken a backseat in China, the world‚Äôs most populous country. Growing pollution has led to unusable waterways, increased incidence of birth defects, and some of the dirtiest air on earth. It‚Äôs so nasty that there‚Äôs now a word for it: ‚Äúsmogpocalypse‚Äù.*
