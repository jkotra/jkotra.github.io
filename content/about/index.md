Hi, I'm Jagadeesh Kotra. 

I am a self-taught programmer and an avid open-source contributor. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's majoring in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.

I like to learn and experiment on subjects related to CS - Programming, Software development, Machine Learning/DL, and other fields. I like dipping my feet into uncharted waters now and then such as Web development occasionally.

I enjoy learning and discovering new things - I became interested in programming due to necessity. at a moment, None of the available solutions are suitable for my use case or not well written, so, I programmed it myself. 

I utilize my spare time either by spending time on my hobbies such as video programming, reading a book, or just binge on a Netflix series. 

My favorite language for scripting in python. for compiled applications/libraries, I usually choose rust for its memory safety features. 

My top 4 programming languages are: 
1. [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
2. [C/C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
3. [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) 
4. [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 


You can view my portfolio [here](/portfolio/), where my most recent works are compiled.
